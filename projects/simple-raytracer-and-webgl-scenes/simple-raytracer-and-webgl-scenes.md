**Simple Ray Tracer**

Simple Ray Tracer is a project demonstrating the implementation of a simple ray tracer in C++, utilizing the **glm** library for vector mathematics and transformations.

The ray tracer is designed to render 3D scenes by simulating the behavior of light rays interacting with objects in a virtual environment. Key features include:

- **Sphere Tracing:** Implements a distance-based method for ray-object intersection testing, optimized for rendering implicit surfaces such as spheres.
- **Lighting:** Supports basic lighting models, including ambient, diffuse, and specular components, to simulate realistic light interactions.
- **Reflections:** Introduces basic reflective surfaces, allowing for mirror-like effects and realistic light bounces within the scene.
- **Scene Configuration:** Simple and flexible scene setup through code, enabling the addition of multiple spheres and light sources for custom scenarios.
- **Performance Optimization:** Uses efficient algorithms for ray tracing computations to achieve reasonable performance on basic hardware.

This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the core principles of ray tracing, including ray-surface intersection, shading, and reflection calculations. The code is clean and modular, making it a great starting point for extending functionality to include features such as textures, advanced reflections, and anti-aliasing.

**Simple WebGL Zen Garden**

Simple WebGL Zen Garden is a course project developed for the **Introduction to 3D Computer Graphics** course at York University. This WebGL-based interactive experience transports users to a serene Japanese-style garden sandbox, offering a tranquil and immersive virtual environment.

The scene is thoughtfully designed to capture the essence of traditional Japanese aesthetics. Key elements include a striking **red Torii gate**, symbolic of passage into sacred spaces, and meticulously crafted **stone lanterns** that provide a subtle, ambient glow. The garden also features **circular ponds**, reflecting the surrounding landscape and enhancing the overall sense of calm. These components are set against a lush backdrop of greenery, creating a harmonious and picturesque virtual world.

Dynamic elements bring the garden to life, including **animated rabbits** that hop playfully around the scene, adding a touch of whimsy and vitality. The reeds and grasses gently sway in response to a simulated breeze, a visual effect achieved through the implementation of **vertex shaders** and real-time animation techniques. These details not only enhance the realism of the environment but also contribute to the meditative atmosphere of the experience.

**Zen Garden** serves as both a technical and artistic exploration, demonstrating proficiency in 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and WebGL programming. The project encapsulates the integration of technical skill and artistic sensibility, offering users a peaceful digital escape into a meticulously designed virtual sanctuary.
