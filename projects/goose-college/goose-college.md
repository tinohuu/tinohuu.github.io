**Goose College** is a charming construction and management simulation game where players step into the role of a college chancellor in a whimsical world inhabited by geese. As the chancellor, players are tasked with designing and building a thriving campus, arranging courses, and managing day-to-day administrative tasks to ensure the smooth operation of their college.

In this unique and engaging game, players can construct various facilities such as lecture halls, dormitories, and recreational areas to accommodate their goose students. The course arrangement system allows players to design specialized curricula tailored to the academic needs of their geese, creating a fun and dynamic gameplay experience. Additionally, the game introduces layers of complexity through event management, resource allocation, and solving unexpected challenges within the campus ecosystem.

Goose College features an isometric art style with clean and colorful visuals that bring the vibrant goose campus to life. The geese, animated with attention to detail, exhibit quirky behaviors that add a touch of humor and personality to the game. Players can also explore mechanics such as student performance tracking, faculty management, and balancing resources to maintain their institution's reputation.

This project was developed as the final assignment for the **MA Games Design** course at London College of Communication, University of the Arts London. It serves as a testament to the integration of creative design, technical development, and strategic gameplay mechanics, highlighting the potential of simulation games to entertain and engage audiences with innovative themes and mechanics.
