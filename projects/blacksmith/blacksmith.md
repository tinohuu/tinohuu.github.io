**Blacksmith** is a meta-game prototype where players step into the role of a blacksmith, tasked with supporting a Hero in their battle against a formidable Supervillain. The blacksmith's primary responsibility is to craft and assign equipment, weapons, and treasure chests to strategically empower the Hero and aid in their quest for victory. This unique setup creates a dynamic interplay between preparation and combat, offering a blend of strategy and creativity.

Originally conceptualized during a **Global Game Jam**, the prototype showcases potential for expansion into an **asymmetric multiplayer experience**, involving three players. In this envisioned design, one player assumes the role of the blacksmith, another embodies the Hero navigating challenges, while the third takes on the mantle of the Supervillain orchestrating obstacles and enemies. This structure encourages collaboration and competitive play, fostering a rich and engaging gaming experience.

The game also features a **complex combat effects system**, introducing five unique elements: **Water**, **Fire**, **Electricity**, **Poison**, and **Earth**. Each element is designed with a diverse set of special abilities, allowing for intricate skill interactions and tactical depth. This system highlights my programming expertise in creating scalable and flexible mechanics that enhance gameplay variety and balance.

By focusing on the meta-game aspects, **Blacksmith** explores the intersection of resource management, player cooperation, and asymmetric mechanics, making it a promising foundation for further development into a full-fledged game.
