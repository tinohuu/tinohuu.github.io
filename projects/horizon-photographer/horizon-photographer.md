Horizon Photographer is a unique 1-minute photography game prototype inspired by Tom Eckersley's iconic *Ocean World* poster. In this interactive experience, players are immersed in a serene scene where a group of whales gracefully leap out of the water under the alternating sunlight and moonlight. Players are given the freedom to capture moments through their lens, recreating the beauty of nature or even replicating the original poster's imagery. Captured photos are displayed as part of the day and night cycle, offering a reflection of the playerâ€™s creativity.

The project is exhibited at *Sound & Cinema: Past, Present & Future* at London College of Communication in January 2020.
