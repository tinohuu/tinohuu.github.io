ZOOM is a puzzle game set in a dystopian 1980s Western Europe, where surveillance and control dictate everyday life. As a government security officer, your role is to monitor citizen activities through a series of surveillance screens and report behaviors deemed unfavorable by the state. The game immerses players in the moral ambiguity of following directives, challenging them to consider the consequences of their decisions.
- **Interactive Surveillance System**: Players engage with multiple screens, scrutinizing live footage for suspicious activities.
- **Branching Narrative**: Decisions carry weight, offering a unique experience with a couple of outcomes and two distinct endings.
- **Immersive Setting**: The gameâ€™s detailed 1980s-inspired environment immerses players in a world of paranoia and control.
