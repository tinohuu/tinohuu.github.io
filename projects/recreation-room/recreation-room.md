This award-winning project, created for the **Ubisoft Toronto** NEXT 2024 competition, showcases a blend of artistic and technical skill in game development, earning the **first place** in the Technical Art category.

The challenge theme required participants to craft a 3D art scene depicting a conflict between humans and aliens on Venus in 2077. The goal was to ensure production feasibility by designing efficient and adaptable solutions for team members across various scenarios.

My submission features a detailed recreation room set in a Venusian environment, highlighting three primary technical challenges and solutions:

### Challenge I: Tentacle FX for Interactive Alien Plant
- Implemented **procedural animation** using a modified **FABRIK Inverse Kinematics** algorithm to simulate dynamic tentacle movements.
- Developed a **custom editor tool** in Unity for adjusting tentacle behavior, enabling artists to easily set up and modify interactions.
- Added a shader-based wriggling effect for idle tentacles to enhance realism.

### Challenge II: Environmental Damage FX from Collision and Conflict
- Designed a **Decal Stamper tool** for applying dynamic damage effects like scratches, dents, and stains in Unity.
- Ensured ease of use with intuitive controls, allowing designers to add or adjust decals directly in the scene view.
- Optimized the tool for performance while maintaining visual fidelity.

### Challenge III: School of Fish Simulation in Aquarium
- Implemented **boid flocking behavior** using compute shaders to simulate realistic fish movement.
- Integrated **escape logic** where fish react dynamically to fast-moving objects, enhancing interactivity.
- Created shader animations for unique swimming styles across different fish species.

In addition to the primary challenges, the project includes other environmental details such as volumetric fog, swaying alien antennas, and shader-based liquid simulations, contributing to an immersive Venusian world.
